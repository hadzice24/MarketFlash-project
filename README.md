## 🧠 Project Summary

In this project, I worked as a data analyst for **MarketFlash**, a growing marketing agency. I was tasked with building a scalable database and an interactive Tableau dashboard to replace their outdated spreadsheet system. This project demonstrates my ability to design a relational database from scratch, work with stakeholder requirements, and turn raw marketing data into actionable business insights.
